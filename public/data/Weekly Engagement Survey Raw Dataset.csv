During the session, I asked a series of questions that were pivotal to understanding the integration of EVM support into Filecoin, which aligns closely with my focus areas. You can find the full list of questions at https://docs.google.com/document/d/119cYju5YDNqNLJPXS2_JyzcAROM30YcvBDodnJ-s9rE/edit?tab=t.0 . 

Key Topics I Explored:

- Integration of EVM into Filecoin: I sought to understand the technical details of how EVM smart contracts are being integrated, whether through a particular layer (e.g., L2 or sidechain) or directly into the protocol.
  
- Cross-Chain Interoperability: I inquired about Filecoin’s collaborations with Solana and Ethereum via CCIP, as it has significant implications for decentralized applications and developers working across chains.

- Developer Tooling: I asked about compatibility with existing Ethereum tools like Truffle and Hardhat and whether developers would need to adapt their toolchains to Filecoin’s environment.


Why This Session Stood Out:

The session provided valuable insights that are directly applicable to the projects I am working on “on ramp contracts” and “FEVM op-codes” (please visit https://feather-address-beb.notion.site/FIL-B-PLDG-11998ea557918017abc6c0f13e2be838 and https://github.com/ZenGround0/onramp-contracts/issues ). These insights will guide us as we implement smart contract functionality that ties together decentralized storage and computation, further empowering the decentralized web and Web3 ecosystems.

I later had a follow-up call with Molly where we discussed utilizing the strengths of EVM compatibility in Filecoin for the development of 2 utility ERC-20 tokens on Filecoin, which I have been trying to deploy to Filecoin Calibration testnet.  Please visit https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2IU_3avnRvXXp8UQmMEuwTH0w4fMfybLqpcAZUOLqk/edit?tab=t.0
",Yes,"Fil-B,Fil-Oz,IPFS,Storacha","I’ve been actively engaging with the Filecoin Builders team, focusing on learning and contributing to projects such as the OnRamp Contract (currently improving the documentation of the GitHub repo: https://github.com/seetadev/onramp-contracts , shared during a recent call with Sarah), exploring FEVM OpCodes, and working on integrating EtherCalc into the Buidl Guidl website.

Molly and ZenGround have been a great help in guiding me, especially since the initial efforts on these projects were developed by the Fil-OZ team. 

I’ve also prepared a list of questions addressing builder adoption for the effort “EVM compatibility architecture”: please visit https://docs.google.com/document/d/119cYju5YDNqNLJPXS2_JyzcAROM30YcvBDodnJ-s9rE/edit?tab=t.0 and page 2 at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2IU_3avnRvXXp8UQmMEuwTH0w4fMfybLqpcAZUOLqk/edit?tab=t.0 
I did discuss with Molly at AMA call. Further, had a follow-up call for the questions I was unable to discuss during AMA call.
I’m set to follow up on these questions with Sarah and will create a pull request at github after discussing it on Monday. Sarah has been a consistent point of contact, especially when working on EVM compatibility and on-ramp contracts. She and Molly have helped tremendously in bootstrapping the tickets related to these projects, providing critical guidance and support as we refine the development process. I will be meeting Longfei and Mike in the coming week’s call.

Wish to also share some of the earlier efforts I undertook in first week and first 3 days of second week before the assigning of the tech-partners:

IPFS Helia Team:

I attended IPFS working group meeting and was an active participant in 2 of the tickets discussed (please visit https://foregoing-plantain-cf9.notion.site/2024-10-03-Helia-Working-Group-10e1def34287818b8ba5c6f453269c90#10e1def342878178a00fe9ebb4ce70d6  )

Our discussions revolved around the IPFS Helia CLI and IPFS Web UI, exploring how to enhance and integrate its functionalities to better serve decentralized applications. We’ve been tackling key areas like performance improvements and ensuring seamless compatibility with other tools.

Storacha Team:
While my interactions with the Storacha team are still evolving for the 2nd ticket assigned by Sarah from Filecoin Builders Group, we’ve discussed areas of collaboration around decentralized storage and how Storacha’s work aligns with the larger Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems; developing a telegram mini app with Storacha as the storage layer.

Across all these teams, the collaborative environment and shared expertise have been invaluable, helping me contribute more effectively to Protocol Labs' decentralized technology stack. Wish to also thank Katie and Anubha for their wonderful support and encouragement. Katie shared key resources and links on FIPs, which enabled us to bootstrap quickly and productively.

",,10,"I’ve had a great experience engaging with the PLDG stewards and the guild’s programming so far. Wish to share a few suggestions that could enhance the experience even further:

Cross-Team Collaboration: Encouraging more opportunities for collaboration between different teams like Filecoin Builders, Filecoin Oz, and other guilds. This could facilitate deeper integrations and bring fresh perspectives to ongoing projects.

Workshops on Niche Topics: Hosting more focused workshops or AMA sessions on niche topics like FEVM OpCodes, on-ramp contracts, or storage-computation synergies in decentralized applications. These could dive deeper into the technical complexities and engage more developers in specialized areas.

The js-ipfs-fetch library, built with Kubo, plays a crucial role in the IPFS ecosystem by providing a fetch-like API for retrieving content via IPFS, making decentralized file access feel as seamless as traditional web requests. Its impact is significant because it simplifies integrating IPFS into web applications, allowing developers to use familiar HTTP-like requests while accessing content from the distributed IPFS network. It’s particularly cool because it's used in projects like the Agregore browser, which aims to decentralize the web experience by using protocols like IPFS.

Impact of my contribution:
This bug affects files with spaces or special characters in their filenames, which are URL-encoded. It makes it impossible to retrieve or serve such files via IPFS, limiting support for a wide range of common file names, particularly screenshots and user-generated content. The issue impacts the reliability of the IPFS protocol handler for many practical use cases, reducing accessibility to files with more complex filenames.

The issue highlights potential optimizations in how Filecoin’s storage capabilities and Ethereum’s smart contracts interact.

4. Testing and Deployment: There is a need for more robust testing to ensure the contracts perform well under different conditions. This includes optimizing gas costs and efficiently utilizing storage and computation resources.

Planned Contributions:
- Improving Documentation: I’ll focus on expanding the repository’s documentation with detailed guides, code comments, and examples to make it easier for new developers to engage.
- Refactoring: I'll also review the codebase to suggest structural improvements and help with modularizing key components, particularly those related to EVM.
- Addressing OpCodes: I plan to analyze the usage of EVM opcodes to ensure they are implemented according to best practices and optimized for interaction with Filecoin.
",Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet + IPC,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2,"The issue outlined in [FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #2(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2) focuses on the integration and optimization of cross-chain messaging for the OnRamp Contracts. This is a key aspect of the OnRamp project, as it enables seamless interaction between Filecoin’s storage capabilities and other EVM-compatible chains, such as Ethereum.

Key Points of the Issue:
1. Cross-Chain Messaging Support: The primary objective of this issue is to evaluate and implement a robust cross-chain messaging solution that facilitates communication between the Filecoin network and other blockchains. This will enable users to bridge assets and data between ecosystems efficiently. Several potential protocols and tools, such as CCIP (Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) or existing messaging frameworks, can be explored for this purpose.

2. Optimizing Gas and Resource Usage: Cross-chain operations can often incur high gas fees and require careful resource management. Part of the issue is to evaluate how these costs can be minimized, ensuring that the OnRamp Contracts maintain efficiency without compromising security or functionality.

3. Security Considerations: Another critical aspect is ensuring that cross-chain messaging and asset transfers are secure. This involves reviewing potential attack vectors, such as replay attacks or contract vulnerabilities, and implementing necessary safeguards to protect users.

4. Interoperability Testing: Testing the integration with various EVM-compatible chains will be crucial to ensure the cross-chain messaging solution is reliable and works seamlessly across multiple environments. The issue calls for creating test scenarios that simulate real-world cross-chain interactions.

Planned Contributions:
- Researching Cross-Chain Solutions: I will start by researching various cross-chain messaging protocols and tools to determine the best fit for the OnRamp Contracts. This may involve reviewing existing projects like Chainlink’s CCIP or exploring other messaging frameworks.
  
- Developing and Testing Cross-Chain Messaging: Once a suitable solution is identified, I will focus on integrating it into the OnRamp Contracts, ensuring it aligns with the existing architecture. Extensive testing will be conducted to validate that cross-chain transfers work as intended.

- Optimizing Gas Costs: I’ll work on identifying areas where gas usage can be optimized for cross-chain transactions, ensuring that the contracts are efficient and scalable.

- Security Enhancements: I will also contribute by reviewing the security aspects of cross-chain messaging and proposing enhancements to safeguard the system from potential threats.
",Identifying use-cases and applications for @libp2p/example-webrtc-private-to-private,https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private,"The project I'm working on focuses on identifying use cases and applications for the @libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private (https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private), which explores how WebRTC can facilitate private-to-private connections using the libp2p networking stack. This use case aims to leverage libp2p’s peer-to-peer capabilities to create a decentralized communication system that can operate securely between private peers without relying on a centralized server.

 Key Points of the Project:
1. Private-to-Private WebRTC Connectivity: The primary goal is to establish direct, secure connections between private peers using WebRTC protocols. This approach has wide-ranging applications for peer-to-peer communications, file transfers, and decentralized apps (dApps), ensuring that users can communicate or exchange data without compromising privacy or relying on central intermediaries.

2. Libp2p Networking Stack: The project is built on libp2p, which provides a flexible networking stack for peer-to-peer communications. The WebRTC example demonstrates how libp2p can be applied to real-world use cases, such as enabling decentralized collaboration tools or messaging platforms that prioritize user privacy.

3. Identifying Practical Use Cases: A major part of my contribution involves identifying the most promising applications for this WebRTC example. These could include decentralized file sharing, secure communication networks, peer-to-peer collaboration tools, or even privacy-focused IoT applications. The challenge is to explore how the underlying technology can serve diverse industries while maintaining security and efficiency.

 DevGrant from Filecoin:
In 2023, I received a devgrant from Filecoin (https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/issues/263) where I tried using libp2p with IPFS. Wish to share that I will dedicate some time exploring how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can be integrated with libp2p’s networking capabilities, especially in the context of peer-to-peer communications.

The project also ties into the broader goal of making decentralized networks more accessible and practical for developers, which is why this example is crucial in demonstrating how libp2p can solve real-world networking challenges while promoting privacy and decentralization.

 Planned Contributions:
- Exploring Use Cases: I’m actively working on identifying and documenting use cases for this technology, ranging from secure messaging and decentralized collaboration platforms to privacy-focused IoT networks.
- Further Development and Refinement: As part of this ongoing effort, I’ll be refining the codebase and exploring additional features to improve the ease of use and adoption of libp2p-based WebRTC applications.
- Integration with Filecoin: Another key aspect is investigating how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can complement this private-to-private connection framework, particularly in use cases that require secure, verifiable storage.

",Yes,4+,Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet ,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1,"The issue at hand, outlined in FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #1(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1), revolves around enhancing the accessibility and comprehension of the project for developers aiming to integrate Filecoin’s capabilities with EVM-compatible environments. 

Project Tasks and Progress this week: 
Project tasks were to implement the deployment steps, verify contract functionality, and troubleshoot any errors that arose during the process.

To achieve this, I collaborated with Abhishek and FIL Builders team, who provided helpful guidance and troubleshooting resources. ZenGround’s gist(https://gist.github.com/ZenGround0/c1b2ce669522f6aac85ef6d9130b5fe0) was especially useful, detailing steps to resolve deployment errors, and referencing related issues within the onramp contracts repository(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues) for further insights.

During deployment, I initially encountered errors, but with Abhishek’s support, I resolved these issues and achieved a successful deployment. I documented this outcome with a screenshot(https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1s_TSbHx5X7jYJxBvaROkUy9yyuVdwAsx) of the deployed contract as proof of completion.

Planned Contributions:
- Improving Documentation: I’ll focus on expanding the repository’s documentation with detailed guides, code comments, and examples to make it easier for new developers to engage.
- Refactoring: I'll also review the codebase to suggest structural improvements and help with modularizing key components, particularly those related to EVM.
- Addressing OpCodes: I plan to analyze the usage of EVM opcodes to ensure they are implemented according to best practices and optimized for interaction with Filecoin.

This project plays a critical role in bridging Filecoin's storage network with Ethereum’s decentralized finance and smart contract ecosystems. By making the OnRamp contracts more accessible and optimized, we can streamline integrations and support wider adoption of Filecoin as a storage layer for EVM-compatible chains.
",Update Readme with correct implementation instructions for calibrationnet + IPC,https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2,"The issue outlined in [FIL-Builders OnRamp Contracts Issue #2(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/2) focuses on the integration and optimization of cross-chain messaging for the OnRamp Contracts. This is a key aspect of the OnRamp project, as it enables seamless interaction between Filecoin’s storage capabilities and other EVM-compatible chains, such as Ethereum.

Key Points of the Issue:
1. Cross-Chain Messaging Support: The primary objective of this issue is to evaluate and implement a robust cross-chain messaging solution that facilitates communication between the Filecoin network and other blockchains. This will enable users to bridge assets and data between ecosystems efficiently. Several potential protocols and tools, such as CCIP (Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) or existing messaging frameworks, can be explored for this purpose.

2. Optimizing Gas and Resource Usage: Cross-chain operations can often incur high gas fees and require careful resource management. Part of the issue is to evaluate how these costs can be minimized, ensuring that the OnRamp Contracts maintain efficiency without compromising security or functionality.

3. Security Considerations: Another critical aspect is ensuring that cross-chain messaging and asset transfers are secure. This involves reviewing potential attack vectors, such as replay attacks or contract vulnerabilities, and implementing necessary safeguards to protect users.

4. Interoperability Testing: Testing the integration with various EVM-compatible chains will be crucial to ensure the cross-chain messaging solution is reliable and works seamlessly across multiple environments. The issue calls for creating test scenarios that simulate real-world cross-chain interactions.

Planned Contributions:
- Researching Cross-Chain Solutions: I will start by researching various cross-chain messaging protocols and tools to determine the best fit for the OnRamp Contracts. This may involve reviewing existing projects like Chainlink’s CCIP or exploring other messaging frameworks.
  
- Developing and Testing Cross-Chain Messaging: Once a suitable solution is identified, I will focus on integrating it into the OnRamp Contracts, ensuring it aligns with the existing architecture. Extensive testing will be conducted to validate that cross-chain transfers work as intended.

- Optimizing Gas Costs: I’ll work on identifying areas where gas usage can be optimized for cross-chain transactions, ensuring that the contracts are efficient and scalable.

- Security Enhancements: I will also contribute by reviewing the security aspects of cross-chain messaging and proposing enhancements to safeguard the system from potential threats.
",Add QUIC transport support,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463,"The ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463) aims to add QUIC transport support to the Python implementation of libp2p. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a modern transport protocol that combines the speed of UDP with built-in features typically provided at higher layers, like security and reliability. The inclusion of QUIC is essential for libp2p to improve low-latency communication, resilience to network changes, and support for connection multiplexing, which is critical for high-performance decentralized networks.

Wish to share that I have started the groundwork on adding QUIC transport support to py-libp2p, as outlined in [project ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463). This ticket involves implementing QUIC, a transport layer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability, into the Python implementation of libp2p. Adding QUIC support is essential for enhancing the network’s performance, particularly for applications that require low-latency, secure, and resilient connections.

I received this assignment from Dave after demonstrating engagement and making contributions across the libp2p ecosystem. Dave was incredibly helpful, taking the time to walk me through the requirements and technical challenges of the ticket. His guidance has been instrumental in outlining the steps needed to integrate QUIC and align it with the existing py-libp2p architecture.

According to the libp2p QUIC documentation(https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/quic/), QUIC provides benefits such as connection multiplexing, security via TLS 1.3, and reduced latency. In the context of libp2p, adding QUIC transport allows more efficient data transmission, improving the network’s ability to handle dynamic network conditions while ensuring secure connections. QUIC's features align well with libp2p's goals for modularity and decentralized connectivity, as it can adapt to network disruptions more effectively than traditional TCP.
","I'm also working on identifying use cases and applications for the @libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private (https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private), which explores how WebRTC can facilitate private-to-private connections using the libp2p networking stack. This project was discussed in detail at go-libp2p maintainer's call. 

 This use case aims to leverage libp2p’s peer-to-peer capabilities to create a decentralized communication system that can operate securely between private peers without relying on a centralized server.

 Key Points of the Project:
1. Private-to-Private WebRTC Connectivity: The primary goal is to establish direct, secure connections between private peers using WebRTC protocols. This approach has wide-ranging applications for peer-to-peer communications, file transfers, and decentralized apps (dApps), ensuring that users can communicate or exchange data without compromising privacy or relying on central intermediaries.

2. Libp2p Networking Stack: The project is built on libp2p, which provides a flexible networking stack for peer-to-peer communications. The WebRTC example demonstrates how libp2p can be applied to real-world use cases, such as enabling decentralized collaboration tools or messaging platforms that prioritize user privacy.

3. Identifying Practical Use Cases: A major part of my contribution involves identifying the most promising applications for this WebRTC example. These could include decentralized file sharing, secure communication networks, peer-to-peer collaboration tools, or even privacy-focused IoT applications. The challenge is to explore how the underlying technology can serve diverse industries while maintaining security and efficiency.

 DevGrant from Filecoin:
In 2023, I received a devgrant from Filecoin (https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/issues/263) where I tried using libp2p with IPFS. Wish to share that I will dedicate some time exploring how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can be integrated with libp2p’s networking capabilities, especially in the context of peer-to-peer communications.

The project also ties into the broader goal of making decentralized networks more accessible and practical for developers, which is why this example is crucial in demonstrating how libp2p can solve real-world networking challenges while promoting privacy and decentralization.

 Planned Contributions:
- Exploring Use Cases: I’m actively working on identifying and documenting use cases for this technology, ranging from secure messaging and decentralized collaboration platforms to privacy-focused IoT networks.
- Further Development and Refinement: As part of this ongoing effort, I’ll be refining the codebase and exploring additional features to improve the ease of use and adoption of libp2p-based WebRTC applications.
- Integration with Filecoin: Another key aspect is investigating how Filecoin’s decentralized storage solutions can complement this private-to-private connection framework, particularly in use cases that require secure, verifiable storage.

This project is part of a larger effort to explore decentralized communication tools, and I’m excited about the possibilities that WebRTC and libp2p can unlock for the future of private, peer-to-peer connectivity.
",10,"The libp2p maintainers' calls for the Rust, Python, and JavaScript modules were incredibly insightful and well-coordinated, offering a valuable platform to connect with fellow developers and gain a deeper understanding of each module’s architecture and ongoing priorities. Here are some feedback and suggestions for the PLDG stewards and guild organizers based on these sessions:

1. Cross-Module Collaboration: The cross-pollination of ideas between maintainers of different language implementations (Rust, Python, JavaScript) was a highlight. Introducing more cross-module discussion time could facilitate even deeper collaboration, allowing maintainers to share challenges, best practices, and architectural strategies across language boundaries.

2. Focused Sessions on Key Features: It would be beneficial to hold specialized sessions focusing on implementing crucial features like QUIC support or WebRTC capabilities across all libp2p implementations. These focused discussions could lead to more consistency and shared resources across the various language implementations.

3. Increased Support for Non-Core Modules: Expanding support for non-core language implementations like `py-libp2p` would encourage growth and parity across implementations. This could include assigning specific stewards or maintaining a stronger mentor program for teams working on smaller, but important, modules.

",Add QUIC transport support to the Python implementation of libp2p,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463,"Wish to share that I have defined the scope of work on adding QUIC transport support to py-libp2p, as outlined in project ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463) at the document : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8-KuDrntDqEnuZQpohhN9huxt79P8Oipx-jlL9OqPI/edit?tab=t.0. Refined scope of work with the help of Adin from IPFS Shifyard team. This ticket involves implementing QUIC, a transport layer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability, into the Python implementation of libp2p. Adding QUIC support is essential for enhancing the network’s performance, particularly for applications that require low-latency, secure, and resilient connections.

I received this assignment from Dave after demonstrating engagement and making contributions across the libp2p ecosystem. Dave was incredibly helpful, taking the time to walk me through the requirements and technical challenges of the ticket. His guidance has been instrumental in outlining the steps needed to integrate QUIC and align it with the existing py-libp2p architecture.


The ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463) aims to add QUIC transport support to the Python implementation of libp2p. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a modern transport protocol that combines the speed of UDP with built-in features typically provided at higher layers, like security and reliability. The inclusion of QUIC is essential for libp2p to improve low-latency communication, resilience to network changes, and support for connection multiplexing, which is critical for high-performance decentralized networks.

Wish to share that I have started the groundwork on adding QUIC transport support to py-libp2p, as outlined in project ticket #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463). This ticket involves implementing QUIC, a transport layer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability, into the Python implementation of libp2p. Adding QUIC support is essential for enhancing the network’s performance, particularly for applications that require low-latency, secure, and resilient connections.

I received this assignment from Dave after demonstrating engagement and making contributions across the libp2p ecosystem. Dave was incredibly helpful, taking the time to walk me through the requirements and technical challenges of the ticket. His guidance has been instrumental in outlining the steps needed to integrate QUIC and align it with the existing py-libp2p architecture.

According to the libp2p QUIC documentation(https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/quic/), QUIC provides benefits such as connection multiplexing, security via TLS 1.3, and reduced latency. In the context of libp2p, adding QUIC transport allows more efficient data transmission, improving the network’s ability to handle dynamic network conditions while ensuring secure connections. QUIC's features align well with libp2p's goals for modularity and decentralized connectivity, as it can adapt to network disruptions more effectively than traditional TCP.

Integrating QUIC in py-libp2p involves adapting the protocol to work with libp2p’s multiaddress format, handling connection upgrades, and ensuring compatibility with other QUIC implementations across different programming languages in libp2p. This integration will bring py-libp2p closer to parity with other libp2p implementations that already support QUIC, thus making it more versatile for cross-language decentralized applications.
","This week, I worked on the project js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private(https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private). The focus of this project was to explore universal connectivity within private networks using libp2p’s WebRTC functionality. In particular, I worked on testing a demo that leverages a service worker gateway to streamline in-browser connectivity for IPFS content.

In collaboration with the team, I tested this demo to evaluate its functionality, and we reviewed the test results through a live link: test results link(https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4zzaneiptp2ftjzwwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/). This testing provided valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of using service workers for improved connectivity and accessibility within decentralized applications.
",10,"I really appreciated the PLDG stewards’ support and the thoughtful structure of the guild’s programming.

With pointers from Raghav, I was able to incorporate more precise explanations and streamline sections to create a more approachable and informative resource for developers. 

These updates, documented in this Google document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTbEUZeQl_MH21WkhBcDffUlE2QMopWOSqrbsDRn1SA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p29kk32yh5bm), aim to facilitate smoother navigation of the project, enhance understanding of its technical nuances, and support effective contributions from the developer community. Working with the FIL Builders team has been invaluable in making impactful contributions to this project.

",Yes,4+,Add QUIC transport support to py-libp2p module,https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463,"Last week, I focused on deepening my understanding of various libp2p implementations to support the addition of a QUIC module to the py-libp2p project, as outlined in issue #463(https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/issues/463). This exploration included studying the Nim implementation of libp2p, which provided valuable insights into QUIC integration approaches and transport protocol design.

Progress so far includes initial planning of the QUIC module structure, outlining compatibility requirements with existing libp2p protocols like GossipSub, and reviewing the nuances of QUIC’s support for efficient, low-latency message transmission. This foundation will allow for seamless integration and help address performance improvements within the py-libp2p project. My next steps involve prototyping the core QUIC functionality and conducting interoperability tests to ensure alignment with libp2p standards.

In addition, I attended meetings with Umar Farooq at the libp2p specification meetings, where we discussed challenges related to large message transmissions in GossipSub. Umar's analysis highlighted the increased message dissemination times and fluctuations that arise with large payloads, shedding light on the underlying causes of these issues.

In these discussions, we also explored potential improvements that could mitigate these dissemination delays without compromising GossipSub’s resilience. The proposed optimizations are straightforward to implement and align well with the existing structure, showing promising results for improving message handling.

This knowledge will be invaluable as I work on integrating QUIC, ensuring that the new module will effectively support efficient, low-latency messaging across large payloads.

This week, I focused on advancing the onramp-contracts project(https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts/issues/1) by identifying new documentation issues and implementing targeted improvements to enhance developer accessibility and usability. My work with FIL Builders has been instrumental in this process, providing direct support and guidance as I refined the project’s documentation.

In particular, ZenGround’s documentation and Raghav's help served as a critical foundation, giving me detailed insights into the project’s structure and the intended behavior of the onramp contracts. Building on this, I was able to identify areas in need of additional clarification or elaboration. This enabled me to add precise explanations and streamline the documentation, ensuring it is more approachable and informative for developers.

These recent updates, which I have documented in a Google document(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTbEUZeQl_MH21WkhBcDffUlE2QMopWOSqrbsDRn1SA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p29kk32yh5bm), will support developers in navigating the project more intuitively, understanding its technical nuances, and contributing effectively. Working alongside the FIL Builders team this week has strengthened my understanding of the onramp-contracts project, empowering me to make impactful contributions to its developer documentation.
",Service worker IPFS gateway,https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway,"Test Result: https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4zzaneiptp2ftjzwwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/

Preparing the documentation steps for conducting QA (quality assurance)/ tests for Service worker IPFS gateway.

With the guidance of Adin Schmahmann, I tested the IPFS service-worker gateway(https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway), an innovative approach to enabling direct browser access to IPFS content. This gateway utilizes service workers to bypass traditional IPFS gateways, aiming to streamline and decentralize data retrieval directly within browser environments.

I conducted a series of tests to evaluate the service worker’s functionality. The test results were captured through a live demonstration link: inbrowser IPFS link( https://bafkreiaofbtkcyv2pws4zzaneiptp2ftjzwwp2e6qqpglhhglm5q3l467i.ipfs.inbrowser.dev/). This link showcases the gateway’s ability to render IPFS-hosted content directly within the browser, illustrating the potential of a fully decentralized web experience.

This project provided valuable insights into the practical applications of service workers for IPFS, highlighting areas where user accessibility and performance can be improved.
","https://github.com/seetadev/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private ( Applications and use cases for private-to-private WebRTC as assigned in go-libp2p maintainers' call): In our recent meetings with Umar Farooq from the libp2p team and Sujata Tibrevala from ByteDance’s OSS team, we explored several potential use cases for the private-to-private WebRTC project. We discussed how the project’s capabilities could enhance secure, decentralised peer-to-peer communication across various applications. 

During libp2p specifical meeting with Umar Farooq, we focused on the large message transmission challenges within GossipSub, which cause longer-than-expected dissemination times and fluctuations. Umar’s work has been instrumental in analysing the underlying reasons for this behaviour and proposing straightforward improvements. These enhancements maintain Gossip Subs’ resilience while significantly improving message handling efficiency.

For the private-to-private WebRTC use case, we plan to prioritize integrating these insights from Umar’s work to optimize performance during large message transmissions. This approach will help ensure smoother and more predictable data transfer, a key requirement for secure, real-time peer-to-peer communication applications.

Sujata offered valuable insights into industry-specific needs, particularly around real-time collaboration tools and secure media sharing, while Umar provided technical context on potential optimizations within libp2p to support these use cases. This collaborative approach has been instrumental in identifying practical, high-impact scenarios where private-to-private WebRTC can deliver value.
